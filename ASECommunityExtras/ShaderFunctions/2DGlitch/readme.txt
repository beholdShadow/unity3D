What: 
Creates a UV offset, an alpha channel and a vertex offset that will allow you to create a glitch effect on sprite!
- Adjust time scale
- Blend the effect with the glitch amount
- Set a glitch texture, something with good contrast works better
- per axis glitch amount
- per axis glitch perturbation (how noisy is the glitch, avoid round values)
- Set the alpha glitch tiling
- Adjust the rect size of the sprite renderer to have more space for the glitch effect

See the example scene to know how to use it on your shaders, it might a bit tricky to tweak values to find the best result, consider it as a good base for a glitch effect,
waiting for improvement and tweaking.
